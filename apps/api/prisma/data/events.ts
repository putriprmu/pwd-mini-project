I was able to catch them on September 1th - the second of the two performances. The Mercury Lounge, an iconic smaller venue, was the perfect intimate setting for the evening, with its fun vibe and fantastic acoustics. If you haven’t been to this venue yet, check it out next time you are on the Lower East Side - or stop by after grabbing a bite at Katz's Deli a block away.\r\n\r\nThe pairing of performances was spot on. Each artist brought their own unique sound to the stage and created a truly enjoyable experience for the crowd. Everyone seemed to have a great night and fully embraced each band",

      "Blur, icons of the 90's Britpop revolution have enjoyed one of the most critically and commercially celebrated careers of any British artist. Their music has been the soundtrack to a generation and fans old and new continue to sell out their tours in mass force to see Damon Albarn and co perform the classic songs.\r\n\r\nFrom the offset, the audience are excited and remain in a sense of hushed anticipation before the iconic group begin their show. The lights go down and deafening cheers ring out to the opening bars of 'Boys & Girls'. It is a risky move opening with one of your most prolific hits but Blur simply energise the crowd as they remain engaged with the show throughout. Albarn thanks them briefly between tracks but with seven albums to fit into a 20 song setlist, time is of the essence.\r\n\r\nLuckily all the big hitters are included, a mass sing/clap along to 'Country House' nearly rips the roof off the Civic Hall before 'Parklife' causes mass jostling within the crowd. It is the anthemic introduction to 'Song 2' which receives perhaps the greatest reaction of the evening. Blur's music does not seem to age and the quartet proves why they are considered titans of Britpop",

This was a celebration of outsider and alternative blues and music inspired by these artists.  Over the years, hundreds of bands have been involved with the festival and also performing at Chris’ Bayport BBQ.\r\n“What excited me about this music was that it was so different,” said Johnson. “It was raw and immediate and went all the way back to the roots, and artists like R.L. and Junior had so much character.”…\r\n”Next came his discovery of artists like the Black Diamond Heavies, Scott H. Biram, and Bob Log — younger independents making music under the influence of Kimbrough, Burnside, and their hill country kin, including Jessie Mae Hemphill and Othar Turner.”\r\nThis new, raw strain of hybrid blues offers deep roots to fans of traditional music. And while Burnside, Kimbrough, Hemphill and Turner are now dead, Kenny Brown, Elmo Williams and Hezekiah Early, and a handful of other Mississippians soldier on.”\r\nExcerpts from The Blues Is Not Dead: The New Blues Underground Rises Up by Ted Drozdowski about Chris Johnson and the Deep Blues Festival.',

      'The debut LP from Miles Francis, Good Man is a work of gorgeous paradox: a nuanced exploration of masculinity and all its trappings, presented in a sound that’s joyfully unfettered. Produced by Francis and recorded in their longtime studio, Good Man arrives as the most visionary and elaborately realized output yet from a polymathic artist known for collaborating with the likes of Angélique Kidjo, Sharon Jones, and Arcade Fire’s Will Butler.\r\n\r\nMainly recorded in solitude but featuring several guest musicians on strings, background vocals, and horns, Good Man takes its title from a spellbinding piece of avant-pop encompassing many of the album’s central themes (e.g., prototypically male impulses and anxieties, the gulf between one’s true nature and meticulously curated presentation). In dreaming up the album’s kaleidoscopic sound, Francis embraced an experimental process that involved elegantly merging their most formative influences. “I grew up with boy-band posters from floor to ceiling in my bedroom, and that music dominated my life when I was young,” they point out. “Later on I studied Afrobeat music and started playing with different groups in that world, which helped me to get to a place where I could be totally free in my musical expression.” Also naming shapeshifters like Prince and David Bowie among their essential touchstones, Francis ultimately alchemized those inspirations into a highly percussive form of art-pop, both lavishly orchestrated and visceral in impact.',

However, unlike other artists of the era such as The Who and The Rolling Stones, comparatively little official concert footage exists of Led Zeppelin. This is largely because of the successful efforts of manager Peter Grant to limit the exposure of the band to television appearances, in order to encourage fans who wanted to see the band to attend Led Zeppelin concerts. Of the few professionally shot concerts the band did, (excluding their July 1973 concert at Madison Square Garden on The Song Remains the Same) six are today available to fans through bootlegs. These concerts include the last two nights of their five-concert run at Earls Court Arena in London in May 1975, their show in Seattle's Kingdome in 1977 and their two shows at Knebworth in August 1979.
